## Simple ASP.NET MVC Application

### What
Library to view and check-out books. Data stored in a database using the EntityFramework. This is intended for beginners who are overwhelmed by the default Visual Studio MVC app.

Subjects: ASP.NET, MVC, C#, Class, Interface, HTML, CSS, Razor Syntax, Database, EntityFramework, SQLite, LINQ, Dependency Injection. 

I learned a lot from: https://github.com/etrupja/DrinkAndGo



### Transformation: 

Application slowly progresses from an HTML page to an interactive website. Steps are separated into branches.
